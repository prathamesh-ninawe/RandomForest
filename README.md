# Coding Assignments: Random Forest Models for Sales Analysis and Fraud Detection

This repository contains two coding assignments that demonstrate the use of Random Forest models for different purposes:

## Assignment 1: Sales Analysis

**Problem Statement:**
A cloth manufacturing company is interested in understanding the attributes that cause high sales. In this assignment, we build a Random Forest model with the target variable 'Sales' (converted into a categorical variable) and use all other variables as independent variables.

**Files:**
- `SalesAnalysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations for the sales analysis using Random Forest.

**Instructions:**
1. Open `SalesAnalysis.ipynb` to understand the sales analysis process.
2. Follow the code, explanations, and visualizations to learn how a Random Forest model is used for sales analysis.

## Assignment 2: Fraud Detection

**Problem Statement:**
In this assignment, we use Random Forest to build a model for fraud detection. We classify individuals with 'taxable_income' less than or equal to $30,000 as "Risky" and others as "Good."

**Files:**
- `FraudDetection.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations for the fraud detection model using Random Forest.

**Instructions:**
1. Open `FraudDetection.ipynb` to understand the fraud detection process.
2. Follow the code, explanations, and results to learn how a Random Forest model is used for identifying risky individuals based on their taxable income.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, etc. (dependencies are listed within the Jupyter Notebooks)

**Note:**
- These assignments are for educational purposes and demonstrate the application of Random Forest models for two different scenarios.
- Feel free to explore, modify, or extend the code to suit your specific needs.

Please refer to the individual Jupyter Notebooks for detailed code and explanations related to each assignment.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.
